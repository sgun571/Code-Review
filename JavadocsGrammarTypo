Your next task is to detect grammartical and typographical errors in code descriptions. In this example, there are 3 errors. To mark these errors click once on each of the errors in the text.

If you need to remove a marked error, click once more on the red dot marking the error. If you feel that an entire sentence should be restructured, place a red dot at the end of the sentence like this.
